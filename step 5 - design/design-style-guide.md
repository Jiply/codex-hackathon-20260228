# Step 5 - Design

1. Lock the core visual language: **Digital Impressionism** first, with soft blur, atmospheric depth, organic gradients, and abstract AI forms.
2. Define fixed design tokens: palette, contrast ratios, blur/noise ranges, gradient formulas, spacing scale, border radii, and type hierarchy.
3. Set image rules: prioritize mood-led, suggestive AI visuals over literal tech clichés; pair with human-context imagery for trust and clarity.
4. Set motion rules: ambient, slow transitions (drift/bloom/dissolve), no harsh effects, and required reduced-motion alternatives.
5. Build reusable component specs: hero, feature card, section divider, social tile, and screenshot frame with fixed typography, spacing, and art treatment.
6. Add strict do/don’t guidance: avoid neon overload, generic “AI brain” graphics, and inconsistent styling across pages.
7. Enforce with governance: one shared design library, QA checklist before release, and monthly review to prevent aesthetic drift.
